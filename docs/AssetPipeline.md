# Asset pipeline 
The Asset Pipeline module is designed to optimize and enhance the management and loading process of resources in your project. This module allows for efficient handling and optimization of graphical, audio, and other types of resources.

## Why Asset Pipeline?

In game development, raw resources, such as graphics, audio, and other multimedia elements, are often not initially optimized for efficient usage within games. These resources may come in high-resolution formats or sizes that can impact the game's performance, increase loading times, and consume unnecessary storage space.

The Asset Pipeline module addresses this challenge by serving as a vital intermediary step in the development process. It takes raw, unoptimized resources and transforms them into a format suitable for seamless integration and optimal performance within the game.
